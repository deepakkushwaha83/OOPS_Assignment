    "Ans->Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays a crucial role in making your code more              flexible, reusable, and maintainable. In simple terms, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common             superclass, especially when they share the same method or interface."

This concept allows us to write more generic and flexible code by using the same interface (method or function) for objects      of different classes.\n",

When an instance of a class with a __call__ method is called, Python invokes the __call__ method, allowing objects to behave like       functions."
