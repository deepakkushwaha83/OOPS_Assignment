In simple terms, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common             superclass, especially when they share the same method or interface."

    "Ans->Polymorphism in Python (and in Object-Oriented Programming in general) refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method         call in different ways. This concept allows us to write more generic and flexible code by using the same interface (method or function) for objects      of different classes.\n",
